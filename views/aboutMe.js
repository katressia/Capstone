    <h2>Information about me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Katressia Moore. I'm married and in April I will be married
      for a year. I'm from Mississippi. I'm the oldest of ten kids. I have
      different hobbies such as
      <li>gaming</li>
      <li>drawing</li>
      <li>painting</li>
      <li>cooking</li>
      <li>baking</li>
      I'm 34 years old and have started my spiritual journey 7 years ago. I once
      had a crazy night happen when on vacation. I then had to learn how to
      spiritually and mentally protect myself. In 2018 I took a certification
      course for reiki. That was my beginning of learning things and building a
      business of helping myself and others.
