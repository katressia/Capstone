  <h1>Meditation</h1><h2>Intro on Meditation</h2><p>
  Meditation is a mental exercise that trains your mind and body on attention and awareness. Meditation has been shown to increase focus, reduce stress, and help calmness. It can help people recognize and accept negative emotions.
</p><p>
    There are different types of meditation. We will be focusing on mindfulness meditation. In this type of meditation, one turns their attention to a single point of reference, such as one’s breath or bodily sensations, or a word or phrase known as a mantra. The practice has been shown to decrease distraction and rumination, make negative automatic thoughts seem easier to let go of, and promote greater enjoyment of the present moment.

    <h2>Chakra Meditation</h2>
    <p>
      Chakra meditation is an Eastern spiritual practice that dates back thousands of years. “Chakra” is a Sanskrit word that means “circle,” "disc," or "wheel".There are seven chakras in total, positioned from the base of the spine to the top of the head. Chakra meditation helps us realign the chakras and bring our body back into balance. When the chakras are aligned and activated, they vibrate at a higher frequency, giving us energy and vitality.
